Project Title:
üåç Climate Change Dashboard: Visualizing Global Warming (1750‚Äì2015)

Participants:
Yashasvi Khurana

Reyansh Bhagat

School: St. Columba's School

Dataset Sources:
Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data (Kaggle)

Global Land Temperatures by Country (Kaggle)

Global Land Temperatures by Major City (Kaggle)

Dataset Link: Kaggle Climate Data

Tools and Technologies Used:
Python 3.10

Pandas

Plotly (for interactive dashboards)

Streamlit (for app deployment)

VS Code (IDE)

Google Chrome (for dashboard preview)

Description:
We created a dynamic and interactive dashboard to visualize climate change trends:

Global Average Land Temperatures from 1750 to 2015

Top 5 Warmest Countries since 1900, using choropleth maps

Temperature Changes in Major Cities over time

2013 Global Temperature Anomaly Map to highlight areas of warming

The dashboard employs advanced data visualization techniques including:

Moving Average Smoothing for clearer trends

Choropleth Mapping for country-level temperature analysis

Multi-Chart Subplotting to compare different regions and times

Interactive Features such as hovering, zooming, and panning for a more immersive experience

Deliverables:
Python code files (.py)

CSV dataset files (.csv)

Recorded Video Demonstration (.mp4)
